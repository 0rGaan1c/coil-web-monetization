# coil-web-monetization

I learned about Web Monetization and how to use it in my own website while doing the challenge for [#LOCALHACKDAY](https://localhackday.mlh.io/).

This website that I built is very simple and contains five images, three of them are visible to everyone and to view the remaining two you will need the Coil membership and install the Coil extension in your browser.
