I learned about Web Monetization and I also learned how to monetize my own website.

The website that I built is very simple and contains five images, three of them are visible to everyone while the remaining two are exclusive. [Coil](https://coil.com/) is a Web Monetization Provider which you can use to view the exclusive images. If you are participating in LHD by MLH then you can get a free Coil trail.
